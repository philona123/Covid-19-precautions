     <h2><font color="#FF000">Myth Busters!</font></h2>
     <h3><ins>Following are the truths over some of the myths that are said to rumoured and giving wrong information to the people worldwide</ins></h3>.
     <ul>
       	<li>From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in <strong>ALL AREAS</strong>, including areas with <strong>hot and humid weather</strong>. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19.</li>
        <li>There is no reason to believe that <strong>cold weather</strong> can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around <strong>36.5°C to 37°C</strong>, regardless of the external temperature or weather.</li>
        <li>Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around <strong>36.5°C to 37°C</strong>, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can <strong>burn you</strong>.</li>
        <li>To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be <strong>transmitted by mosquitoes</strong>. The new coronavirus is a <strong>respiratory virus</strong> which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person <strong>coughs or sneezes</strong>, or through <strong>droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Spraying alcohol or chlorine</strong> all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be <strong>harmful to clothes or mucous membranes</strong> (i.e. eyes, mouth).</li>
